## What’s Happening
The National Park Service in Yosemite is implementing a permit system permanently impacting climbers.  
  
>
## Why it Matters
Climbers are among the best self-managed user groups in Yosemite, with a strong history of working alongside the park service.  NPS has historically used regulation to remove every user group from Yosemite that doesn't align with their goals.  As a privileged user group -- and as people of the land -- climbers continue to fight in a multi-generational struggle for access and land rights.

<span class="dropcap">B</span>ig-wall climbers in Yosemite have a long and well-documented history of working with the National Park Service to self-regulate.  Meanwhile, using a global pandemic as their initial leverage, the NPS is moving to permit all overnight climbers in Yosemite.   
  
As innocent as that sounds, big-wall climbing has a deep history and culture that could be dramatically affected by a permit in Yosemite.  Two tenants of big-wall climbing are timing and self-reliance. Big-wall climbers trained in Yosemite have proven incredibly successful at managing these things.   
       
Permitting in this way is entirely new, and it is up to us to say something.  New climbers may never learn some of these higher skills under the watchful eye of the NPS.

## NPS Standing Firm    
Representatives from the NPS have repeatedly stated that the permitting system is not going anywhere.  The same rangers have also asked for climber input, leaving some people wondering about the underlying intentions of NPS.   
  
NPS has said they will be in Bishop at the Craggin’ Classic in an informal capacity for outreach regarding the permit system.  This event is the last chance to comment officially in person.  NPS is also accepting comments on its website.[^1]  
  
If you have been paying attention in recent years, you are familiar with this process.  Camping in the Valley has also transitioned to online lotteries.  It looks like that is here to stay.

## Climbers Have Spoken   
Major media outlets Climbing Magazine[^2]&nbsp;[^3], Gripped[^4]&nbsp;[^5], Men’s Journal[^6] and The Daily Beast[^7] have all reported on this issue.  There are hundreds of posts on social media and many articles on the internet in protest of an overnight permit in Yosemite.[^8]   
  
### Climber Comments
Users of the pilot system have been vocal.  Climbing Magazine quotes [Kevin Deweese](http://kevindeweese.com/):[^2]   
>“ The climbing rangers have done a lot of good work to try to make [permits] accessible and not something detrimental to actual access.  Climbers are not a massive user group compared to the overall number of visitors in the park. [And] if climbers are a small subset, then big wallers are an even smaller subset of that small subset.  As long as we are being good stewards, the amount of actual damage that we can do in terms of environmental damage is relatively small.”  
  
Don Wilson posted on Facebook after a recent El Cap ascent:[^9]   
>“ When I picked up my permit I also had a few general questions on the permit system, and had a nice conversation.  The ranger seemed open about the plan and answered all my questions. Without any specific query from me, the ranger told me to expect quotas in the future on the 4 most popular wall routes, specifically the Nose, Salathe/Freerider, WFLT, and SFWC.  It came across as though that was already planned.”  
  
John Middendorf, international climber, and former YOSAR volunteer, comments:[^10]  
>” Yosemite permit systems do not work well, and are incompatible with big wall climbing, as timing is everything.  Climbers are one of the best self-managed user groups in the National Park System and do not need this level of control.  The climbing ranger system has been a great tradition to build and maintain climber relations, and is all that is needed.”  
  
### Real-World Issues
The issues climbers face on the wall are all about access and timing.  A permit system has not been proven necessary.  A permit system designed appropriately could aid access and allow better timing.   The current permit system impacts both of these things negatively.      

### Adapting the Current System for Climbers 
The permit could be adjusted to more appropriately reflect climbers' needs in many ways.  
  
Any decision with this level of impact deserves a thoroughly democratic process.  The effectiveness of the pilot program is questionable and uses skewed data.  We can do better.  
  
There is absolutely no reason for this system to use closed-source private software.  We do not need to pay a private entity for permit registration.  A better online permit system can be built and maintained inexpensively with open-source tools.  
  
The data collected from the permit system could and should be transparent in real time.  This could be of great use to climbers planning ascents.   
  
Same-day registration should not cost anything.  There is no need to interact with a ranger to register.   
  
None of this is hard to achieve in 2022-2023.  Please email the author with design or technical questions about a permit system that works for the people.

## Big-Wall Community    
Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) is a volunteer organization created by big-wall climbers to work alongside the National Park Service and self-regulate.  YOSAR has been very effective.  Some of the most recognized climbers worldwide have been members of the climbing ranger program.  
  
The National Park Service has failed to provide evidence to support increased regulation beyond YOSAR.  
  
The Facelift is a yearly tradition in Yosemite organized by climbers.  These community members have worked with YOSAR and NPS for years to mitigate the impact in Yosemite.  This is a prime example of the big-wall community coming together to help maintain the park.     
  
In 2022, NPS used photos from the Facelift to take credit for the organization.  While taking credit for the work of climbers, they chose to highlight the relatively minor long-term impact of big-wall climbers in a glaring way.[^2]  
  
It has been repeated tirelessly on social media that most litter picked up during the Facelift comes from parties that bail, in-a-day ascents, and tourists wandering around the base of the walls.    
  
Another lost data point is the community shared between climbers on the wall.  Countless official rescues never happened because of another, better-prepared party on the wall.  The author has been near three minor incidents and one major trauma on the valley walls, none reported to YOSAR.

## Big-Wall Permits in Yosemite  
Big wall climbing in Yosemite has a lot of analogs to big mountain alpinism.  The big difference is that Yosemite climbing is not typically full of the objective hazard managed in snow-and-ice alpine climbing.  Climbing safely in Yosemite is, however, entirely conditions-dependent.  
  
The NPS has argued that the new permit provides more knowledge of when climbers are on the wall, and has helped to require fewer rescues.[^2]  

They have also mentioned litter as an issue with the climbing community.   There are a few other things mentioned in the request for comment.  All of them are non-issues if people appropriately follow Leave No Trace.  
  
The pilot system was released immediately following an international catastrophe.  Data gathered during this period needs to consider this, as many people were very strict about not traveling.  
  
There is no room for miles of rope left on the walls as trash, and the climbing community has a history of cleaning up Yosemite and practicing Leave No Trace.  Yosemite Facelift has cleaned up thousands of pounds of litter left by other user groups.  
  
There is cell service in the Valley.  NPS documenting the location of every climber on the walls is not necessary.  Anyone with a cell phone can easily share this information with emergency services in 2022.

## Potential Negatives  
The public discussion and NPS have gone back and forth on eventual quotas.  As defined by the park service, quotas are potential usage limits on popular routes.   
  
One possible future outcome of the suggested permit system is the increased popularity of an already risky activity, speed climbing.  Speed climbing has the potential for huge rewards when approached with care, and the potential for catastrophe when things go wrong.   
  
The last thing we need as a climbing community is a system that encourages miseducated people to attempt walls in a day.  
  
Overnight climbing in Yosemite has been one of the last ways a mixed or indigenous person could experience some bit of what once was in the Valley overnight.  Paying to get on route, or interacting with an authority figure beforehand are now mandatory.  What is freedom, but a dream of the past?

## Potential Benefits  
This permit system allows the park to say they are actively managing climbers and educating climbers on proper use.  The permit also provides increased data on the activity of climbers in the park.  
  
In a time when climbing is more popular than ever before, someone needs to be educating new climbers.  Climbing gyms are not a complete solution, nor are commercial guides.  This is a role for the climbing community, and NPS has taken this into its own hands.  
  
From an administrative perspective, it’s easy to see why the overnight permit system feels like a win.  Yosemite National Park has shown that they are excited to share visitor metrics as marketing points.  It’s easy to find documentation of how many tourist dollars they make.   
  
Easy to assume there is some pressure on NPS to determine how much money climbers are bringing into the park.  
  
Arguably the greatest benefactor of this overnight permit system is Recreation.gov.  Recreation.gov is a privately-owned corporation holding government contracts.  All lottery and registration fees paid to Recreation.gov are private funds that will never go back into the park.   
  
To the big-wall climber, this is no different than paying an access toll to a private highway contractor – long after the road was built and paid for by taxpayer dollars.

## Global Permitting Systems  
The Mayor of a small town at the base of Mt. Blanc made international headlines earlier this year.  He pledged to charge all climbers a deposit of 15,000 euros to cover expenses brought on by unprepared climbers.  As of October 2022, it is not clear that the fine is in place.  Authorities have closed the two most popular huts serving routes on Mt. Blanc.

Massive permit fees and undereducated participants have long been the realm of the alpinist.  Western climbing in the greater alpine ranges has been an expensive, wasteful activity since its inception.  Local authorities in these places have long recognized this and taken their cut.

Historically, these types of expeditions were funded by governments, making permits a great tax opportunity.  Western alpinism is famous for its gatekeeping, limiting access only to privileged individuals.  The people most impacted by these systems are always those climbers and families living amongst the peaks we love.

## When Permits Make Sense
Permits can be a helpful way to monitor access to dangerous or remote locations.  In alpine scenarios, climbers face massive routes and objective hazards, often far outside cell service.  In unexpected, extreme weather this can alert emergency service providers to the possibility of an emergency ahead of time.  
  
Big wall climbing in Yosemite is not alpine in this way.  Alpine conditions can occur unpredictably.  The most dramatic rescue stories in the Valley begin this way.  This is when YOSAR could use this additional data.  
  
Fortunately, these instances are few and far between.  The requirement in Yosemite to carry a synthetic sleeping bag when on a wall is well-founded, and a direct result of these rescues.  This is an excellent recommendation and serves to educate unfamiliar climbers.  As regulation, these thought processes bring up unforeseen consequences.
  
Regulation limits access, intentionally or not.  Permits gatekeep access, intentional or not.  Increasing regulation is never something to take lightly, and it is nearly impossible to recognize the full effects beforehand.    
  
Police exist to protect property.  Police increase regulation to increase their perception of control.  This is always something to avoid.  
  
Rescue in extraordinary circumstances and community stewardship are the purposes of the climbing ranger system.  No one wants to make their job more difficult.  A permit system that only benefits the park service is not helping climbers.  
  
Impacting end users to ease administrative operation is terrible design.

## A History of Regulation   
We can all appreciate the grandeur and beauty of Yosemite.  Unfortunately, not everything is so simple.  We all should know that beauty doesn't keep in a cage.  
  
The history of land use in Yosemite is problematic.  It's time to face that reality.
  
The mission of the National Park Service is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.[^11]  
   
The core values of the National Park Service are integrity, stewardship, respect, engagement, collaboration, and accountability.[^12]  
   
It remains easy to find information on tourist income in Yosemite National Park.  Little public information exists on the impacts of mass tourism or NPS use in the Valley.    
  
If only the National Park Service were true to its values.  The valley floor would be nearly unrecognizable.  All land control and access rights would have been given back to the Miwok and Paiute peoples many years ago.  The Wawona Tunnel Tree would be 2,400 years old.  There would be no Wawona Tunnel.  

Instead, we are given the bones of a few homes and some artifacts as a reminder.  
  
The mission and core values of NPS sound great.  Reality is much more complicated.  It's all written down.   
  
Those interested in further personal study could research Aramark, the MRSA outbreak in Yosemite, and the treatment of the Miwok people.

## Are Permits the Future?  
NPS has outlined its next steps.  Though their words sway like leaves in the wind, the meaning sings clearly.  We will begin to see additional usage limits imposed on the more popular multi-day climbs in Yosemite.  Let us fight to keep this from happening.  

New climbers interested in wall climbing with limited access are the soul of our sport.  In this day and age, there is no excuse for not helping to educate these people.  They are the responsibility of everyone in the community.

It has been shown and stated that the park service intends to take measures that impact all of us if we can't break bread with the few.
