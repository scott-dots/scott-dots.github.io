Reservations will not be required to enter the park starting summer 2023.  The entrance fee is $35, and vaild for seven consecutive days.

Reservations have been required to enter the park during the summers of 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Reservations are still strongly recommended by the park service if you plan to stay overnight in Yosemite.
