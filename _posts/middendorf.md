>Yosemite permit systems do not work well, and are incompatible with big wall climbing, as timing is everything. Climbers are one of the best self-managed user groups in the National Park System, and do not need this level of control. The climbing ranger system has been a great tradition to build and maintain climber relations, and is all that is needed.
